# CANTest

A board designed to test CAN connectivity between 2 arduino nanos

The CAN bus is made using mcp2551 and mcp2515.

LEDs were placed to monitor SPI and CAN activity for debug purposes. A new, cleaner version is being designed (see TXDemo).

This designed was intended simple on a single faced PCB in order to produce it with tools I had under hand.

You might need to use my library:
